# Book-rating-prediction_v1
### The aim of this project is to train a machine learning model to predict book rating and deploy it in a streamlit web app.
### All the steps from importing, data analysis, feature engineering, machine learning model and streamlit app will be explained within the notebook.

#### There are 3 main steps: 

#### Step 1: Reading dataset and core data analysis
#### Step 2: Feature engineering and data preprocessing (based on data analysis)
#### Step 3: Machine learning Model

#### The deployment on streamlit is made available through 3 files: app.py which executes the functions from two other files: explore_page.py and predict_page.py
#### Explore_page.py contains Exploratory Data Analysis and Detailed analysis of machine learning results
#### predict_page.py contains Average rating Prediction
