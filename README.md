# Book rating prediction - Emmanuel Gakosso - DSTI

## Link to the deployed app: https://emmanuel558-book-rating-predi-book-rating-prediction-app-2dmh9i.streamlit.app/

#### The deployment on streamlit is made available through Book_rating_prediction_app.py

### The aim of this project is to train a machine learning model to predict book rating and deploy it in a streamlit web app.
### All the steps from importing, data analysis, feature engineering, machine learning model and streamlit app will be explained within the notebook.

#### There are 3 main steps: 

#### Step 1: Reading dataset and core data analysis
#### Step 2: Feature engineering and data preprocessing (based on data analysis)
#### Step 3: Machine learning Model

#### I choose two models for this job: Linear Regression and Random Forest 

### The reasons: 
** Linear Regression is a well-established and widely used method in predictive modeling for continuous data, which makes it a natural choice for predicting the average rating of a book.
** It is a simple model that can easily be interpreted and explained, making it a good choice for understanding the factors that contribute to the rating of a book.
** Additionally, the assumptions of linear regression are relatively easy to understand and diagnose, making it easy to evaluate the quality of the model and the reliability of its predictions.
